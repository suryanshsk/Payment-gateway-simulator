## 🎯 Key Features to Demonstrate

### 1. Multiple Payment Methods (30 sec)
- Show all 5 payment options in dropdown
- Explain how form changes dynamically

### 2. Fee Calculation (20 sec)
- Pay ₹1000 via Credit Card → ₹20 fee (2%)
- Pay ₹1000 via UPI → ₹0 fee
- Explain Strategy Pattern

### 3. Transaction History (20 sec)
- Click "History" button
- Show saved transactions in table
- Point out CSV file `transaction_history.csv`

### 4. Error Handling (20 sec)
- Try empty amount → Error message
- Try invalid card → Error message
- Explain exception handling

## 🏆 What Makes This Project Special?

### ✅ Design Patterns Implemented
1. **Strategy Pattern** - Fee calculation (different fees for different methods)
2. **Factory Pattern** - Creating payment objects dynamically

### ✅ OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- **Classes**: 15+ classes
- **Inheritance**: PaymentMethod → CreditCard, DebitCard, UPI, etc.
- **Polymorphism**: Same method, different behavior
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with getters
- **Abstraction**: Abstract PaymentMethod class

### ✅ Other Features
- **Exception Handling**: 5+ custom exception classes
- **File I/O**: CSV file for transaction history
- **GUI**: Modern, interactive Swing interface

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### Opening (1 min)
"We've developed a Payment Gateway Simulation that demonstrates all core OOT concepts including Design Patterns, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, and File I/O."

### Demo (2 min)
1. Show successful payment
2. Show different payment methods
3. Display transaction history
4. Demonstrate error handling

### Technical Explanation (2 min)
1. Explain Strategy Pattern with fee calculation
2. Show Factory Pattern for object creation
3. Point out inheritance hierarchy
4. Highlight exception handling

### Q&A Tips
- **Q**: Why use Strategy Pattern?
  **A**: To make fee calculation flexible and easy to extend without modifying existing code

- **Q**: What's the benefit of Factory Pattern?
  **A**: Centralized object creation, easy to add new payment methods

- **Q**: How is data stored?
  **A**: CSV file with transaction details, easy to view in Excel

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "javac is not recognized"
**Solution**: Install JDK and add to PATH
```powershell
# Check if Java is installed
java -version
javac -version
```

### Problem: Program doesn't start
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the correct directory
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\admin\OneDrive - MSFT\Payment Gateway Solution"
dir  # Should show PaymentGateway.java
```

### Problem: Cannot find file
**Solution**: Compile first, then run
```powershell
javac PaymentGateway.java
java PaymentGateway
